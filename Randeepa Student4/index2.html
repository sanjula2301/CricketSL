                      So basically what i have done is as student 4 is 
                      made an color picker at the top of the page 
                      to pick a background color while that color is chosen 
                      it will display the hex value of that color. Towards the center of the page 
                      i have created 5 images including what they are, 
                      when you move the mouse towards that part it will hove the description. 
                      And finally i have used a footer to link my pages Index and Index 2
